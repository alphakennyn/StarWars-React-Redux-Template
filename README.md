# A React/Redux StarWars template page #


### What is it ###
So while making a portfolio, I realised there weren't any templates that used the Star wars intro as a scrollable page.

I figured, why not make one myself.

### How it works ###
In our Redux side, we have an value that increases our number *position* over time or whenever the user scrolls down. We then feed the *position* value as the top value of our intro wrapper.

#TL;DR# 
wrapper's top value is equal to our redux *position* value

### Installation ###
* npm install
* npm run dev
* May the force be with you.
